# phpgdo-session-cookie

Cookie / AES driven session management provider for phpGDOv7.
Store sessions on user devices instead on your server.
Cookie tempering is avoided by AES-CBC encryption.


## Installation

Do not install gdo6-session-db! Instead choose this one and name it "Session".
This is handled by the gdoadm.sh CLI installer.

    cd gdo6/GDO/
    git clone https://github.com/gizmore/gdo6-session-cookie Session
	
    
### Enjoy!
